# 🎮 Number Guessing Game

A simple JavaScript-based number guessing game that runs in the **browser console**. The computer picks a random number, and your job is to guess it. You’ll get hints if your guess is too high or too low — or you can type `quit` to give up!

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The game asks you to enter a **maximum number**.
2. It generates a **random number** between 1 and your maximum.
3. You try to **guess** the number through prompts.
4. You’ll receive **hints** until you guess correctly or type `"quit"`.

All interactions happen through the browser's **console**.

1. Clone the repository or download the files.

2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

3. Open the **developer console** (Right-click → Inspect → Console tab).
